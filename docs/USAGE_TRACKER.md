# Cursor Usage Tracker

**Goal:** See how much we get done per 1–2% usage.

---

## Baseline
- **Start:** 63%
- **Target:** Stay under ~80% (leave buffer)

## Log (update as you go)

| Step | Task | Usage Before | Usage After | Δ |
|------|------|--------------|-------------|---|
| 0 | Baseline | 63% | — | — |
| 1 | Comments count trigger (Claude → Cursor apply) | | | |
| 2 | Storage + media upload (Claude → Cursor apply) | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |

## Remaining MVP (pick as budget allows)

- [ ] .cursorignore + docs move (Cursor, ~0.5%)
- [ ] Layout/overflow fixes (Cursor, ~1%)
- [ ] Wallet auth for comments (split: Claude → Cursor, ~3–5%)
- [ ] Other polish

## When to pull punches
- **>75%:** Prefer small tasks, skip big features
- **>80%:** Stop new work, only critical fixes
- **Cheap moves:** Use Auto model, short prompts, no Thinking mode
